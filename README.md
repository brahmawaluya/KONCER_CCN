# Koncer_CCN
Simple Convolutional Neural Network for identifying letter X or O

Run `Koncer.m` to get the resulting value of letter X and O
evaluated from x convolution component

Edit the .csv files in folder Database/ to change to another letter
Don't forget to change the convolution component xa,xb,xc .csv or oa,ob,oc .csv
All the function is in `Koncer_class.m`

To update the fully connected layer, run `Koncer_backprop.m` from gautam1858
